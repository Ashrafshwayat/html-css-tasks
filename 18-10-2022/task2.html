<p>The great mountains that are around us, the sky that extends everywhere, the rocks, the water, and the atmosphere, all create what is called “nature”, which is of wonderful beauty, as it is rich in renewable resources, and nature supports life in its various forms on our planet.

    And all living things in the world get support in their lives from nature, because nature is what works to direct the cycle of air, water and life between different things on earth, and it not only provides our basic requirements for survival, but also provides raw materials to support the industries that the world works on Mainly speaking as well.
    
    As population numbers are increasing dramatically in many parts of the world, resource use has now turned to depletion, in addition to this tremendous rates of air and environmental pollution, as industrial waste and uncontrolled use of vehicles, illegal logging, poaching of animals, and nuclear power plants And many others have contributed to disrupting the systems of nature and global warming.</p>
